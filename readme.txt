Special Thanks to: 
crossproduct, for the original version of the Crystalis Randomizer EmoTracker pack.
The EmoTracker Discord, for helping me figure out how to work with EmoTracker, and how to make it do things it probably isn't supposed to. :)
The Crystalis Randomizer Discord for entertaining obscure logic questions in my attempt to make this as accurate as possible
donpete, for providing the East/GBC Cave detail map.
The Poptracker documentation, for answering all my questions before I needed to ask them

Info:
This is a map and item tracker that attempts to account for all possible combinations of flags that affect logic. This is meant for use with the latest branch of the randomizer, found at https://crystalisrandomizer.com/latest/. As such, the logic of the tracker may not match exactly the logic of the game if you are using the stable version of the randomizer. 

Some notes on usage: 
	-For the Me and We flags, use the Walls/Bosses/Misc tab to indicate which bosses you can beat and which walls you can clear. These should populate automatically if connected to the Archipelago server.
	-If playing with the Rt flag, you can right click on the Sword of Thunder to cycle through all the possible warp points, to show you what you have access to. 
	-If using the Wm flag, individual sub-maps will have doors that can be clicked once to indicate that you have found that door, or twice to indicate the door is blocked by the map structure.  When you have the ability necessary to reach that door regardless of the structure, the door locations should disappear from the map.

Flags that show as a red X when selected are currently not implemented in the logic.

Version History:

v1.0.0
	- First release of the Poptracker version of this pack; adapted the existing Poptracker pack into this.
